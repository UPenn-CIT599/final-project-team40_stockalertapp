# final-project-team40_stockalertapp

CIT 591 Final Project:


This program allows the user to enter a stock ticker, get the useful technical and statistical analysis of its trading history, and get stock alerts displayed on the graphical user interface (GUI).

STARTING THE APPLICATION : 
The application can be initiated by way of the main method in the runner class (Runner.java). 

Personal Computers will launch the graphical user interface at which point there are instructions on adding a security ticker to the view (Hit the '+' and enter the stock ticker in the text field input box).  Each stock request will make an API call that has a 13 second window between calls built-in to ensure compliance with the third party's requirements.  Alternatively, the user can load a file named portfolio3.ser by clicking the menu button, denoted by the triple bar, and selecting Load Stock List.  From the file chooser select the 'portfolio3.ser' file.
