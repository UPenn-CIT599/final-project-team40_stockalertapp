Project Description:

This program allows the user to enter a stock ticker, get the useful technical and statistical analysis of its trading history, and get stock alerts displayed on the graphical user interface (GUI). The program pulls the historical data, current price, and financial indicator data from via a third-party API from https://www.alphavantage.co/. The program plots the data on the User GUI and allows the user to add/remove alerts based on the financial indicators. The program can then calculate the alerts to see if any have triggered. 


Work Breakdown:

1. Joseph Kravets found the AlphaVantage API to pull the stock data. Joseph worked on the Stock, DataPull, OHCLV, StockTest, and DataPullTest classes. He focused on pulling the historical open, high, low, close, and volume data and current quote data. 
2. Tiffany Choi worked on the Alerts, Stock, Financial Indicators, and DataPull classes. She focused on pulling techncial indicator data from the third-party API, wrote the methods to add and remove the alerts, and wrote the method to calculate alerts to notify the user of any triggered alerts. 
3. Robert Stanton worked on the GUI, data display, and user input and functionality of the application. He worked on the AlertButton, Alert Panel, AlertRemovePanel, AlertWindow, BaseGui, Chartdata, Chartdatatest, ChartGui, ConsoleUI, PanelRight, ProgramController, RandomPriceGenerator, Runner, StockCallback, StockDetailButton, StockListPanel, and TableGUI classes.
