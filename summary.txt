This project is titled "Stock Alert App". 
This program allows the user to enter a stock ticker, get the useful technical and statistical analysis of its trading history, and get stock alerts displayed on the graphical user interface (GUI). 
It pulls the historical data, current price, and technical indicator data from a website called https://www.alphavantage.co/. 
We then calcuate if we should send any alerts and plot the data on the user gui.  
Joseph Kravets tried yahoo-finance api and the alphavantage api and decided that the alphavantage api was better. 
He worked on the Stock, Datapull, OHCLV, Stocktest, and Datapull test classes.
He focused on getting the historical open high low close volume and current quote data. 
Tiffany Choi worked on the Alerts, Stock, Financial Indicators, and Datapull classes. 
She focused on pulling techncial indicator data from the api and calulating alerts to notify the user of strong signals.
