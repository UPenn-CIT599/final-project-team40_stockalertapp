Project Description:

This program allows the user to enter a stock ticker, get the useful technical and statistical analysis of its trading history, and get stock alerts displayed on the graphical user interface (GUI). 

The program pulls the historical data, current price, and financial indicator data from via a third-party API from https://www.alphavantage.co/. 

The program plots the data on the User GUI and allows the user to add/remove alerts based on the financial indicators. The program will then calculate the alerts to see if any have triggered.
